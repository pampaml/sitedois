 	 	<p id="Sentence"> Didn’t understand a thing, but we could always sing.- <em>Paul McCartney</em></p>
		<p>The european band that become famous in <strong>1960</strong> until the end of the 70's, the type of music have a taste of rock, rock pop and a weird changing of rhythms. In my opinion this changing is the reason of why Beatles is so good, i mean, make us think about the rhythm and every detail about the song.</p>

	 	<p>I cannot forget the storytelling in some songs and the amazing album that they have, Paul, George, john and Ringo made to us a history on the industry of music and left great songs to us.
		</p>
	
		<p>A good song that i like is called <em><strong>Get Back</strong></em> tell a history of a guy that leave your city behind and go to California to live his life the part of the song that portray it is a little bit like this <strong><em>Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass</em></strong></p>
